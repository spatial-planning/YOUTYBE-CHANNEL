## Need of planner
According to the times of India, there is requirement of as much as 3 lakh planners by 2031, and asper January 2019, we hardly have 5,000 qualified planners and as the urbanization is growing with fast speed, it surely will need more and more numbers of planners……..

According to The economic times, India as on April 2015 has just 1 planner for 75,000 urban population ………………… and urban population is just 34% of total nation’s population.

*But wait a minute, what is planning??? Is it same as architecture??? Or is it Event planning??? Or financial planning??? Heath planning???*

## Definition of Planning
<span style="color:green">```Put 5-6 definition of planning with different source here.```</span>

For easy explanation, planning is for people, people are involved in some or other activity for their livelihood and entertainment etc and all these activities needs small or large space.

Take planning as an interrelation of “people”, “activity” and “spaces”.

People of different cast, creed, religion, gender, interest, education, race, ethnicity, income, etc do different economic, social etc activity at a place which is different in terms of location, accessibility, connectivity, climate, topography, natural resources, monitory value, applicable rules and regulations, etc etc etc. ……….. so many factors, aren’t they??? Imagine applying permutation and combination on this. Number of different types of people* number of different types of activities* number of different type of places…………. Won’t that be uncountable!!!!!! This is why it is said that planning is highly contextual. In chemistry no matter where on earth you perform the test, zinc will replace copper from copper sulphate solution, laws of force are defined in physics, in mathematics, 2+2 will never be 5, but in planning, same action done on two different individuals, or at two different location may produce drastically different results.

There are obviously some key characteristics of planning which can be seen as orthodox in any particular Time, Place, Generation. These fundamental values and principals, exist through decades, maybe centuries?These persisting characteristics, which define the planning profession as special, linking the ortohdoxy of any age of planning, are the 'lamps of planning'. According to TREVOR ROBERTS there are total seven lamps which exist in town planning .The seven lamps are the lamp of place, the lamp of time, the lamp of reason, the lamp of opportunity, the lamp of delight, the lamp of power and last the lamp of life. There exists only seven right now but planning is so dynamic and encompass almost everything, there may come a time when only few of them remains which only few matter to us or the list can go bigger...Who Knows?

## Development
 What according to you will be your development??? When you get a better paying job??? A job giving more holidays??? Bigger house??? Expensive Cars and bikes??? Whatever it may be, one just need to learn the fact that the same word “development” will have a different meaning for the tribal community of Andaman and Niccobar Island.

 Some of the formal definitions of planning are:

 “The carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land or the making of any material change, in any building or land, or in the use of any building or land and includes sub-division of any land.”<span style="color:red"> As per Model Regional and Town Planning and Development Law/ URDPFI page 418.</span>
``` Put 3-4 more definition of development with different source here ```

The paradigm change in definition of development can be seen as shift from economic perspective in 18th century to Human development perspective in 20th century , to social development perspective and today in 21st century, everyone is focused on Sustainable development. According to Amartya Sen the current defition of development is a multi-dimensional perspective one, the development not only in one sense but looking at others threads too. The development in overall sense for an individual entity is that development when the individual has the freedom to pursue what he/she values in the life. Freedom itself is the degree of capability of that individual. 

To understand the complexity of “diversity”, consider a case where women of a town/ village have to travel at least 5 km every day to fetch water. As a third person, one will always want to help them, to provide water connection to every home. Isn’t it???? What if it comes out to be a bad decision for the women!!!! Yeah, you heard it right, even if they don’t have to travel 5km to fetch water, the women are not liking it, in fact haaaaaaating it. Puzzled… aren’t you??? The hidden fact was, the women were not allowed to step out of the home. Fetching water was only time when they got to interact with each other. Stunned!!!! This type of societies actually exists. Again……….Planning is highly contextual.

So its upto the individual, what type of planning on wants to do, advocacy planning??? Equity planning??? Rational Planning??? Incremental panning??? Community Based Planning??? Radical Planning??? Or post modernist planning???
